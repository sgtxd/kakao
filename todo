sxd revived todo list 2.0 because some people are retards and cant back up files properly

    - Focus on stability and write the code first before making it look pretty.
    - Dont trust any user inputs, so check it (regex etc...).
    - Reuse parts of the unfinished sxd rewrite because it has proven itself
        ->  Also makes sxd2 and 3 commands compatible with the rewrite.
    - Automatic updater over github (Things with checksums or something)

    - Data collection
    -> Really pick anything that is able to help with developing the bot and notify the user about it. Make it also able for the user to opt out of it.


    Suggestions for style:
        -> theres a call where it looks like the bot is writing, use that i guess when its processing stuff

    Oh yeah also the bot should create a .json file when being run for the first time because github
